C++ Templates & Metaprogramming

This repo is about rebuilding core C++ standard library utilities to really understand templates, value categories, and object lifetimes.
It also has algorithm implementations written in a generic, template-heavy style for practice and exploration.

All code related to standard library utilities lives in the stl/ folder.
